# Lab | Reading About Statistic Concepts


## Challenges

### Challenge 1: What is the difference between expected value and mean?
You know both concepts but, is there a difference? Are they synonims? Start investigating. 

#### Answer


### Challenge 2: What is the "problem" in science with p-values?
We have told you that a lot of scientifical investigations are based on p-values. The last week, Nature magazine published [an article](http://nature.social/statistical4) regarding the problem. Start digging on it!

#### Answer


### Challenge 3: Applying testing to a specific case: A/B testing.
A/B testing is a widely used tool to understand differences between two samples. It is a way to measure the impact of something we did: 
* A marketing campaign.
* A new feature in our application. 
* A new design in our application.
* A different flow in the User Experience flow.

To do this, is very important first to design our experiment. 
* We need to know how we are measuring the impact. If people has the behaviour we want with this new implementation.
* We choose a control group (people who doesn't have/see the new change) and the group which will see the new change. 
* We think about how much data do we need.
* We measure the difference between them.

One example:
Our application has a lot of mini-games. We want people to reach the games that we think are the best but the behaviour is not the expected, they don't reach them.

So we call a designer and after a lot of work he shows us a new design for our application: we will add a botton specific for that kinf of games inviting the users to click on it:

*Click here to discover cool games!*

We think it will work but can we be sure? So instead of implementing this new botton for all users, we implement it for 10% and we compare the results with the users that didn't have it. Is there a significant difference? Is our botton working?

Read more about A/B testing with a couple of examples:


So, take one single example in the articles you just read, which specific test/s would you apply? (We want you just to do a draft and think a little bit how to apply the tests you already know in this case)
