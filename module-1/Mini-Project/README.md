## Project Description
My project focuses on programming the Mastermind game. 
The game is about breaking color codes based on feed-backs and it interested me because of its high interactivity.

## Rules
Two players first must chose even number of games to play and number of guesses in each game: 6, 8, 10, 12. 
Players then take turn in code making and code breaking. Codemaker smakes up a code, which is not visible to the
codebreaker and consists of any 4 color combination from 4,6 ... colors. Codebreaker then proceeds to guess the code
and after each guess receives a feed-back - red peg for correct color in correct position and white peg for correct color
in incorrect position. In case of duplicates only the correct combinations of color+position are rewarded, and only with 
red peg. In each game, codemaker is awarded one point for each guess the codebreaker takes and a bonus point if the codebreaker
is uneable to guess the code in the given nymber of guesses.

## Workflow
- Research the game
- Design game structure
- Program: Build function to configure the game
- Program: Build function to input choice
- Program: Build function to input guess
- Program: Build function to provide feed-back
- Program: Code role reversal and score count
- Error-handling
- Test game
